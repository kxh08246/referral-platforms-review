## How do I choose between customer referral and professional partner programs?

Customer referral programs work best when you have satisfied buyers who naturally recommend products to friends. Professional partner arrangements make sense when influencers, bloggers, or complementary businesses want ongoing relationships promoting your brand. Many platforms like ReferralCandy and Tapfiliate support both types simultaneously, letting you test what drives better results for your specific business.

## What referral rewards actually motivate people to share?

Percentage discounts between 10-30 percent, dollar amounts matching your average order value, cash payments through PayPal, or free products all perform well depending on your audience. Test different incentive structures—some customers prefer immediate discounts while others respond better to cash. Tiered rewards that increase as advocates refer more customers often boost long-term participation.

## How quickly can I launch a functional referral program?

Most platforms get you operational within a few hours to a couple days. ReferralCandy integrates with major ecommerce platforms in under an hour, while Tapfiliate reduces setup time by 50 percent compared to manual methods. Platforms offering dedicated advisors like Referral Rock provide hands-on implementation support, speeding deployment while ensuring strategic soundness.
